ToDo List:

  * Keep a hash of ids to robustly check for duplicates
  * create TEI header method adding nodes
  * incrementing div1s "n" attribute
  * Program crashes for unknown reason with error message that is commented out
  * Initial, Middle, Final
  * Include an error message about having too few or too many stars on a page, or in the file. 
    Maybe do that for div1s too.
  * Add warning if double spacing is found in the body.	
  * Div2 and div1 entries labeled starting from 1, not 0, as we are now doing with linecount.
  * Comment out debugging printing to stderr

 
  
Questions:
 *   Need to figure out how to encode the XML output. With encoding in toprettyxml() set at None,
     autotagger creates a well-formed XML file, but one with encoding set at '?' in the XML Declaration.
     But with encoding of 'utf-8', tab and newline characters are actually printed as '\t' and '\n',
     making the file all one line that isn't well-formed according to Exchanger XML. 
 * Should multiple lines at the beginning of a page be stripped? Or just at the end after the text and before the next page?


Fixed:
  * catching Line #: in body that isn't an error
  * asterisk skipping problem. Wasn't unicode, was the try clause. Also errors in transcription file
  * add first div2
  * last 8 pages not printing
  * Last half of pg. 399 - end is repeated in output.
  * make a create_div1 method to clean up code, like the create_div2 method
  * Linecount should start at 1 not 0
  * One more div2 not being filled correctly
  * last page not printing
  * line issue with double spaces print or not
  * TEI header included into the autotagger code
  * page 371 empty p node?
   * At some point diary entries are not getting correct content.
      -----At what point does the diary content become incorrect?

Desiderata for future iterations:
  * provide configuration model for autotagger:
    ** first option here is 'multilinugal=yes/no'
  * Maybe include percentages of each type of error in the error messages
  * Reorganize as python module
  * Regression test
