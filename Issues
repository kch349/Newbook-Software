ToDo List:
  * One more div2 not being filled correctly
  * last page not printing
  * incrementing div1s "n" attribute
  * line issue with double spaces print or not
  * Maybe include percentages of each type of error in the error messages
  * Initial, Middle, Final
  * TEI header included into the autotagger code
  * Linecount should start at 1 not 0
  * page 371 empty p node?
  * make a create_div1 method to clean up code, like the create_div2 method
  * Include an error message about having too few or too many stars on a page, or in the file. 
    Maybe do that for div1s too.
  * Add warning if double spacing is found in the body.	
  * Program crashes for unknown reason.

Fixed:
  * catching Line #: in body that isn't an error
  * asterisk skipping problem. Wasn't unicode, was the try clause. Also errors in transcription file
  * add first div2
  * last 8 pages not printing

Desiderata for future iterations:
  * provide configuration model for autotagger:
    ** first option here is 'multilinugal=yes/no'
