To Do List:
  * asterisk with wrong unicode? -- example on page 66
  * last few pages not printing
  * incrementing div1s "n" attribute
  * line issue with double spaces print or not
  * Maybe include percentages of each type of error in the error messages
  * Initial, Middle, Final
  * TEI header included into the autotagger code
  * add first div2
  * Linecount should start at 1 not 0
  * page 371 empty p node?

Fixed:
  * catching Line #: in body that isn't an error
