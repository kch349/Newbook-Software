ToDo List:
  * Initial, Middle, Final
    --If you set the attribute as I or F in the current set up of the program, div2s may be out of order since the 
      program checks the page header for new div2s before checking the body for div1s. In order to assign the part attribute
      properly I think we may need to move it into the later organize_nodes method. 
  * Include an error message about having too few or too many stars on a page, or in the file. 
    Maybe do that for div1s too.
  * Add warning if double spacing is found in the body.
  * Verify or add attribute for line numbers of trip headings and margin notes, and remove the line number from the output
  * remove "Text:" lines from the linecount
  * Check and see if British pound sign is displayed correctly by Python
  * Maybe record which pages trip headings occur on in order to verify if they are working correctly
 
Questions:
 *   Need to figure out how to encode the XML output. With encoding in toprettyxml() set at None,
     autotagger creates a well-formed XML file, but one with encoding set at '?' in the XML Declaration.
     But with encoding of 'utf-8', tab and newline characters are actually printed as '\t' and '\n',
     making the file all one line that isn't well-formed according to Exchanger XML. 
 * Should multiple lines at the beginning of a page be stripped? Or just at the end after the text and before the next page?

Fixed:
  * Comment out debugging printing to stderr
  * incrementing div1s "n" attribute --- fixed, moved div1_count = 0 to outside of page loop
  * catching Line #: in body that isn't an error
  * asterisk skipping problem. Wasn't unicode, was the try clause. Also errors in transcription file
  * add first div2
  * last 8 pages not printing
  * Last half of pg. 399 - end is repeated in output.
  * make a create_div1 method to clean up code, like the create_div2 method
  * Linecount should start at 1 not 0
  * One more div2 not being filled correctly
  * last page not printing
  * line issue with double spaces print or not
  * TEI header included into the autotagger code
  * page 371 empty p node?
   * At some point diary entries are not getting correct content.
      -----At what point does the diary content become incorrect?
  * create TEI header method adding nodes
  * Div2 and div1 entries labeled starting from 1, not 0, as we are now doing with linecount.
  * Keep a hash of ids to robustly check for duplicates (add "i" on duplicates)
  * Warning for duplicate pages ^and ids
  * Program crashes for unknown reason with error message that is commented out

Desiderata for future iterations:
  * provide configuration model for autotagger:
    ** first option here is 'multilinugal=yes/no'
  * Maybe include percentages of each type of error in the error messages
  * Regression test
  * Code Reorganization:
    **Reorganize as python module
    **Option for verbose developper output
    **Lessen the number of times the program loops through the file
