to the telegram, & he was very
sorry at my brother Henry
why he did not tell him
so, and he told that there

proceed to Marseilles &
Baghdad as he is a minor

so unless on some cause
or crime then he can be
expulsed; but as for being
taken as a solider this is
impossible, no foreign subject

to go to D Rosen the German
Consul, I met his Kawass
with a letter for me asking
me to go & see him, so I
went, we spoke over the
matter of Alexander and
the letter he had written to the
German Ambassadore
in Paris, and as I saw that
it only contains the prevention
of his getting married, and
this he cannot do it
firstly because he has not
yet attained 25 years as
the rule is in France Austria
etc, & 2d  he cannot do it
without my consent,
it is useless writing about
it since he cannot be
married, so he wrote a
letter to Julietti asking him
to withdraw the letter &
telegraph to Beyrout to
return it & I will then
pay the expences; D. Rosen
told that we better wait

make some excuses, I

that as Père Pièrre must 

be now gone to Paris about

today or tomorrow before

starting for Baghdad,

it would be a good change

to wire to him to go & see

let him go & paid the

Pièrre like a fool sent
